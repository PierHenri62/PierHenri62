- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PierHenri62
I'm an old man with a lot of time and some rests of curiosity
I'm testing progs on Arduino.
Interested also by all that is approaching music (as i'm an old guitarist).
At least, an AVC made me a bit less comprehensive than before...!
sorry for that "coocking" english
so long
Pierre
